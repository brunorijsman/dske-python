TODO: Add statistics management API and topology command to query it.

TODO: More unit test cases to get code coverage up

TODO: Put .out files in a sub-directory

TODO: OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation should show proper type for request and response data

TODO: Error if get-key-with-key-ids if the API is invoked on client which is not actually one of the
