TODO: Zero out bytes when they are allocated

TODO: Remove block from pool when it is completely allocated

TODO: Add a Key class to keep track of the key logic (separate class for initiator and
      responder?)

TODO: Key has unique key UUID

TODO: Key initiator: Select N peer hub (initially: all peer hubs)

TODO: Key initiator: Allocate PSRD bytes for each peer hub

TODO: In key-share message: encrypted key-share

TODO: In key-share message: none + HMAC over encrypted key-share + nonce + shared secret (+ more?)

TODO: Have client unregister itself from all hubs when it shuts down.

TODO: Retry client registrations when they fail.
      Perhaps use tenacity

TODO: Add statistics management API and topology command to query it.

TODO: Add support for local distributors.

TODO: Add log messages

TODO: Setup CI/CD environment

TODO: Implement mTLS authentication of SAEs on the ETSI QKD interface.

TODO: Remark about ETSI QKD API
      For now, we assumed that there is exactly one SAE attached to every DSKE client, and that the
      SAE ID is the same as the name of the DSKE client. Generalize this to allow any number of SAEs
      to be attached to DSKE client, and to allows the SAE IDs to be different from the DSKE client
      name (this will require the SAE to be authenticated).

TODO: Remark about ETSI QKD API
      For now, we only support GET (and not yet POST) for the ETSI QKD Get Key and Get Key with IDs
      APIs.

TODO: Remark about ETSI QKD API
      For now, we do not yet support the number or size parameters for the ETSI QKD Get Key API.

TODO: Make registration more REST-like
      POST registration resource to register
      DELETE registration resource to unregister
      GET registration resource to query registration status

TODO: More unit test cases to get code coverage up

TODO: Have the hub assign an ID to each peer client; we don't really need it but the draft talks
      about it a lot.

TODO: Perhaps move all of the common packages (psrd, key) to a single package, namely package
      "common"?
