TODO: Second get-key-pair fails

TODO: Better error response if authentication key is bad (and return to pool if allocated)
      - Bad block uuid
      - Start and end of range
      - Already allocated
      - Etc.

TODO: Move code coverage data files to subdirectory

TODO: Stop all nodes after each test (to make sure they are stopped if test case fails)

TODO: Add a test cases with a netcat (nc) listener squatting the port

TODO: Make sure key has unique key UUID

TODO: Key initiator: Select N peer hub (initially: all peer hubs)

TODO: Have client unregister itself from all hubs when it shuts down.
      The API call should use the DELETE method.
      Shutting down should not cause the client to unregister itself; make unregistration
      an explicit option.

TODO: Allow a client to register itself again (after a restart). Done; just need to test.

TODO: Add statistics management API and topology command to query it.

TODO: Add log messages

TODO: Remark about ETSI QKD API
      For now, we assumed that there is exactly one SAE attached to every DSKE client, and that the
      SAE ID is the same as the name of the DSKE client. Generalize this to allow any number of SAEs
      to be attached to DSKE client, and to allows the SAE IDs to be different from the DSKE client
      name (this will require the SAE to be authenticated).

TODO: Remark about ETSI QKD API
      For now, we only support GET (and not yet POST) for the ETSI QKD Get Key and Get Key with IDs
      APIs.

TODO: Remark about ETSI QKD API
      For now, we do not yet support the number or size parameters for the ETSI QKD Get Key API.

TODO: More unit test cases to get code coverage up

TODO: Add Sphinx documentation
      Use https://github.com/tox-dev/sphinx-autodoc-typehints 

TODO: Cleanup share after all clients have retrieved it, or after timeout.

TODO: Request new PSRD blocks when they run low (have a threshold)

TODO: Use async features to send all shares to the peer hubs in parallel, instead of sequentially
      one after the other. Ditto for getting the shares on the responder client.

TODO: Better way to avoid circular imports that then current # type: ignore

TODO: Make the swagger docs also work off-line

TODO: Type annotations everywhere

TODO: Implement and test get multiple keys over ETSI QKD API

TODO: Implement and test get non-default key size over ETSI QKD API

TODO: Tests get wrong key-id over ETSI QKD API

TODO: Test creation and deletion of PID file

TODO: Figure out how to debug the code (set breakpoint from VSC and document that)

TODO: Put .out files in a sub-directory

TODO: OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation should show proper type for request and response data

TODO: Error if get-key-with-key-ids if the API is invoked on client which is not actually one of the
      slaves for that key.

TODO: Use data (instead of value) in Fragment for consistency. Also in documentation (including
      figures)
