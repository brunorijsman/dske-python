TODO: Second get-key-pair fails

TODO: Better error response if authentication key is bad (and return to pool if allocated)
      - Bad block uuid
      - Start and end of range
      - Already allocated
      - Etc.

TODO: Move code coverage data files to subdirectory

TODO: Stop all nodes after each test (to make sure they are stopped if test case fails)

TODO: Add a test cases with a netcat (nc) listener squatting the port

TODO: Make sure key has unique key UUID

TODO: Key initiator: Select N peer hub (initially: all peer hubs)

TODO: Have client unregister itself from all hubs when it shuts down.
      The API call should use the DELETE method.
      Shutting down should not cause the client to unregister itself; make unregistration
      an explicit option.

TODO: Allow a client to register itself again (after a restart). Done; just need to test.

TODO: Add statistics management API and topology command to query it.

TODO: Add log messages

TODO: More unit test cases to get code coverage up

TODO: Add Sphinx documentation
      Use https://github.com/tox-dev/sphinx-autodoc-typehints 

TODO: Cleanup share after all clients have retrieved it, or after timeout.

TODO: Request new PSRD blocks when they run low (have a threshold)

TODO: Use async features to send all shares to the peer hubs in parallel, instead of sequentially
      one after the other. Ditto for getting the shares on the responder client.

TODO: Better way to avoid circular imports that then current # type: ignore

TODO: Make the swagger docs also work off-line

TODO: Type annotations everywhere

TODO: Tests get wrong key-id over ETSI QKD API

TODO: Test creation and deletion of PID file

TODO: Figure out how to debug the code (set breakpoint from VSC and document that)

TODO: Put .out files in a sub-directory

TODO: OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation should show proper type for request and response data

TODO: Error if get-key-with-key-ids if the API is invoked on client which is not actually one of the
      slaves for that key.

TODO: Use data (instead of value) in Fragment for consistency. Also in documentation (including
      figures)
